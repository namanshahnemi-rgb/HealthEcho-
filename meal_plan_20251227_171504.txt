As an expert nutritionist and meal planner, I've crafted a comprehensive 7-day vegetarian meal plan specifically designed for your goals: weight loss, managing high-severity diabetes, and supporting your beginner running journey. This plan prioritizes blood sugar stability, sustained energy, and nutrient density, while adhering strictly to your vegetarian preference and avoiding all forbidden foods.

## 📅 7-DAY PERSONALIZED MEAL PLAN

**Important Note on Provided Recipes:** The "Tomato Pesto Chicken Pasta" and "Quinoa Salmon Bowl" recipes are not vegetarian and therefore cannot be incorporated into your plan. The "Vegetable Curry" with 6 calories and 0.4g protein is nutritionally insufficient; I have created a realistic, diabetes-friendly vegetarian curry recipe for you.

Here's your actionable meal plan, focusing on whole grains, leafy greens, and lean plant-based proteins.
