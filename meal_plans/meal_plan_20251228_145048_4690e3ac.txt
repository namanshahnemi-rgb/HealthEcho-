As an expert nutritionist and meal planner, I'm delighted to create a comprehensive, personalized 7-day meal plan tailored to your goals and preferences.

First, a quick note on the recipes you provided:
*   **Tomato Pesto Chicken Pasta**, **Quinoa Salmon Bowl**, and **Quinoa Salmon Bowl v2** are not suitable for a vegetarian diet as they contain chicken and salmon.
*   **Vegetable Curry (6 cal, 0.4g protein)** is nutritionally inadequate as a main meal for weight loss or general health.

Therefore, I will be creating a completely new set of balanced, vegetarian meals that align with your weight loss goal, support your running activity, and are practical for a beginner.
