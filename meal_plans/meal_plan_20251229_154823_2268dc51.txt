## 🌱 Your 7-Day Vegetarian Meal Plan for Weight Loss

### **Important Notes from Jenny:**
*   **"Veg" Assumption:** This plan assumes an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet (includes dairy and eggs). If you follow a strict vegan diet, please let me know, and I can adjust!
*   **Hydration:** Aim for 8-10 glasses (2-2.5 liters) of water daily. Keep a water bottle handy!
*   **Meal Timing:** Try to eat your meals and snacks at regular intervals (every 3-4 hours) to maintain energy levels and prevent overeating.
*   **Listen to Your Body:** This plan is a guide. If you're genuinely hungry, opt for extra non-starchy vegetables or a small piece of fruit. If you're full, don't feel obligated to finish everything.
