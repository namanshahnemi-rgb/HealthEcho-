7-DAY MEAL PLAN
================================================================================

As an expert nutritionist and meal planner, I'm delighted to create a comprehensive, personalized 7-day vegetarian meal plan tailored to your goals of weight loss and supporting your beginner running journey.

**Important Note Regarding Provided Recipes:**
The recipes you provided were either non-vegetarian (Tomato Pesto Chicken Pasta, Quinoa Salmon Bowl) or had an extremely unrealistic calorie count for a meal (Vegetable Curry at 6 calories). Therefore, I have created a completely new set of vegetarian, weight-loss-friendly recipes and meal ideas with estimated nutritional values to meet your specific dietary preferences and goals.
