## ✨ Your 7-Day Vegetarian Weight Loss Meal Plan ✨

**Goal:** Weight Loss
**Activity:** Gym (Beginner)
**Diet Preference:** Vegetarian
**Estimated Daily Calories:** 1800-2200 kcal

### **Important Notes from Jenny:**

*   **Listen to Your Body:** This plan provides a great framework. If you're genuinely hungry between meals, reach for extra veggies, a small handful of nuts, or a piece of fruit. If you're not hungry, don't force a snack.
*   **Hydration is Key:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day – aim for 8-10 glasses (2-2.5 liters). Water helps with satiety, metabolism, and overall health.
*   **Adjust as You Go:** Weight loss is a journey, not a race. We'll discuss how to tweak things later, but remember, consistency is more important than perfection!
*   **Enjoy the Process:** Food should be a source of joy and nourishment. Savor every bite!
