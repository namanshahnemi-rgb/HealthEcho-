7-DAY MEAL PLAN
================================================================================

Hello Jenny!

It's great to connect with you. Based on your profile, while some details were a bit playful, I've interpreted your request as a desire for a comprehensive, balanced, and easy-to-follow meal plan focused on general health and wellness. I'll aim for a moderate calorie intake suitable for a moderately active adult maintaining their weight, and ensure a good balance of macronutrients.

**Important Note on Your Provided Recipes:**
I noticed some significant calorie and protein discrepancies in your provided recipes (e.g., Tomato Pesto Chicken Pasta with very high calories but low protein, and Vegetable Curry with extremely low calories). As an expert nutritionist, I've made the following adjustments to ensure your meals are balanced and contribute positively to your health goals:
*   **Tomato Pesto Chicken Pasta:** I've adjusted the portion size and assumed a more balanced macro profile for a single serving (increasing protein significantly) to make it a suitable meal.
*   **Quinoa Salmon Bowl (v1 & v2):** I've divided these into reasonable single-meal portions to fit within a daily calorie target.
*   **Vegetable Curry:** The 6 cal, 0.4g protein is not realistic for a main meal. I've created a standard, healthy vegetable curry meal with appropriate estimated calories and protein.
