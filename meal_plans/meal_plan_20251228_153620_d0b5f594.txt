### **SUNDAY: Prep Day Success!** 🗓️
Before we kick off the week, a little prep goes a long way. Dedicate an hour or two on Sunday to set yourself up for success!

#### **Meal Prep Tips for Sunday:**

1.  **Cook Grains:** Prepare a large batch of cooked quinoa and brown rice. Store in airtight containers in the fridge.
2.  **Wash & Chop Veggies:** Wash and chop bell peppers, cucumbers, carrots, onions, garlic, and leafy greens. This saves precious time during the week.
3.  **Roast Veggies:** Roast a tray of sweet potatoes or mixed vegetables (broccoli, zucchini) to add to bowls or have as sides.
4.  **Make Dressings/Sauces:** Prepare any salad dressings or sauces that can be stored for a few days.
5.  **Hard-Boil Eggs:** Cook a batch of hard-boiled eggs for quick snacks or additions to meals.
6.  **Portion Nuts/Seeds:** Divide nuts and seeds into small containers for easy grab-and-go snacks.

### **Hydration & Timing Recommendations:**

*   **Hydration:** Aim for at least 8-10 glasses (2-2.5 liters) of water daily. Keep a water bottle handy! Herbal tea and sparkling water also count.
*   **Meal Timing:** Try to eat your meals around the same time each day to regulate hunger. Listen to your body – eat when you're hungry, stop when you're satisfied. Don't skip meals!
*   **Mindful Eating:** Take your time with each meal. Savor the flavors, textures, and aromas. This helps with satiety and digestion.
