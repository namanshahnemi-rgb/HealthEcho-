### 🌟 **Sunday Meal Prep Tips for Success** 🌟

Dedicate a couple of hours on Sunday to set yourself up for a successful week!

*   **Cook Grains:** Prepare a large batch of cooked quinoa (3-4 cups dry) and brown rice (3-4 cups dry). Store in airtight containers.
*   **Chop Veggies:** Wash and chop hardy vegetables like bell peppers, carrots, celery, onions, and broccoli florets. Store in containers in the fridge.
*   **Make Dressings/Sauces:** Prepare any salad dressings or sauces needed for the week (e.g., lemon-tahini dressing, simple vinaigrette).
*   **Hard-Boil Eggs:** Cook a batch of hard-boiled eggs for quick snacks or additions to meals.
*   **Roast Veggies:** Roast a large tray of mixed vegetables (e.g., zucchini, bell peppers, sweet potatoes) for easy additions to lunches or dinners.
*   **Soak Legumes (if using dried):** If you plan to cook dried chickpeas or lentils, soak them overnight on Saturday.

### 💧 **Hydration & Timing Recommendations** 💧

*   **Water is Key:** Aim for at least 8-10 glasses (2-2.5 liters) of water daily. Start your day with a large glass of water!
*   **Listen to Your Body:** Eat when you're hungry, stop when you're comfortably full. This plan provides structure, but feel free to adjust meal timing slightly to fit your unique schedule.
*   **Mindful Eating:** Take your time, savor each bite, and pay attention to your body's hunger and fullness cues.
*   **Pre-Yoga Snack:** If you practice yoga in the morning, a small banana or a handful of berries 30-60 minutes before can give you energy without feeling heavy.
*   **Post-Yoga Refuel:** Within an hour after yoga, aim for a balanced meal or snack with protein and complex carbs to aid recovery.

### ⚖️ **How to Adjust for Weight Changes** ⚖️

This plan is set for a healthy weight loss range (1800-2200 kcal).
*   **If Weight Loss Stalls:** Try reducing portion sizes slightly for one meal (e.g., 1/4 cup less rice, a smaller piece of fruit for a snack) or increase your activity. Aim for the lower end of the calorie range (~1800 kcal).
*   **If You Feel Too Hungry/Low Energy:** Increase portion sizes slightly (e.g., an extra 1/2 cup of vegetables, a small handful more nuts for a snack) or ensure you're consistently reaching the higher end of the calorie range (~2200 kcal).
*   **Listen to Your Body:** The most important thing is to find a sustainable approach that makes you feel good. Consistency is key!
