Hello there! 👋 I'm Jenny, your personal Registered Dietitian and meal planning expert. I'm absolutely thrilled to help you kickstart your weight loss journey with a delicious, realistic, and satisfying 7-day vegetarian meal plan!

This plan is designed to be packed with flavor, easy to follow, and full of nutrient-dense foods that will keep you feeling full and energized, especially as you embrace your walking routine. We're aiming for a calorie range that supports sustainable weight loss for a beginner walker – around 2200-2400 calories per day – giving you plenty of fuel without overdoing it.

Let's make this week a success! 💪🥗
