### **🌟 Sunday Meal Prep Tips for a Smooth Week Ahead 🌟**

Spending a couple of hours on Sunday can transform your week!

*   **Cook Grains:** Prepare a large batch of cooked quinoa and brown rice. Store in airtight containers.
*   **Roast Vegetables:** Chop and roast a variety of vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers, sweet potatoes) for easy additions to lunches and dinners.
*   **Batch Cook Protein:** Grill or bake a large batch of chicken breast or lean ground turkey.
*   **Wash & Chop Produce:** Wash all your fruits and greens. Chop veggies like bell peppers, onions, and carrots for quick stir-fries or salads.
*   **Portion Snacks:** Pre-portion nuts, seeds, and fruit into small containers or bags.
*   **Hard-Boil Eggs:** Boil a dozen eggs for quick grab-and-go snacks or breakfast additions.

---

### **💧 Hydration & Timing Recommendations 💧**

*   **Hydration is Key:** Aim for 8-10 glasses (2-2.5 liters) of water daily. Keep a reusable water bottle handy!
*   **Pre-Workout:** Hydrate well 1-2 hours before your workout. A small piece of fruit or a rice cake 30-60 minutes prior can provide quick energy.
*   **Post-Workout:** Aim to have your post-workout meal (often lunch or dinner) within 60-90 minutes to aid muscle recovery. If your workout is much earlier, a protein shake or your planned mid-morning snack could work well.
*   **Listen to Your Body:** Eat when you're hungry, stop when you're satisfied. This plan is a guide, not a rigid rulebook.

### **⚖️ How to Adjust for Weight Changes ⚖️**

This plan is a fantastic starting point! Your body is unique, and progress isn't always linear.

*   **If Weight Loss Stalls:**
    *   **Reduce by 100-200 calories:** Consider slightly reducing portion sizes of healthy fats (e.g., 1/2 avocado instead of 1/4, 1 tbsp olive oil instead of 1.5 tbsp) or complex carbohydrates (e.g., 3/4 cup cooked rice instead of 1 cup).
    *   **Increase Activity:** Add an extra 15-30 minutes of walking or low-intensity cardio.
    *   **Ensure Accuracy:** Double-check your portion sizes – it's easy for them to creep up!
*   **If You Feel Too Hungry/Low Energy:**
    *   **Add 100-200 calories:** Incorporate an extra serving of vegetables, a small handful of nuts, or an additional piece of fruit. Ensure you're getting enough protein.
    *   **Re-evaluate Sleep & Stress:** These can significantly impact hunger and energy levels.
*   **Consult a Professional:** If you're consistently struggling, don't hesitate to reach out to a dietitian for personalized guidance!
