It's fantastic that you're committed to your health goals with a vegetarian diet and an intermediate yoga practice. My goal is to create a plan that not only supports your weight loss journey but also fuels your body with vibrant, nutrient-dense foods, keeps you energized for your yoga, and makes every meal a delightful experience.

This plan focuses on lean plant-based proteins, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and plenty of fiber-rich fruits and vegetables to keep you feeling full, satisfied, and nourished. We'll aim for approximately 1900-2000 calories per day to support your weight loss goal while providing ample energy.

Let's get you ready for a week of deliciousness and success! 💪🥗
