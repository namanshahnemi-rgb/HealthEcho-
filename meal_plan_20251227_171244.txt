As an expert nutritionist and meal planner, I'm excited to create a comprehensive, personalized 7-day meal plan to support your weight loss journey as a beginner vegetarian runner!

First, I must address the "AVAILABLE RECIPES" you provided. There are critical issues that prevent me from incorporating them into your plan:
1.  **Dietary Preference Conflict:** The "Tomato Pesto Chicken Pasta" and "Quinoa Salmon Bowl" recipes are not vegetarian, which contradicts your dietary preference.
2.  **Calorie & Goal Conflict:** The calorie counts for these recipes (e.g., 2705 cal for pasta, 1300+ cal for salmon bowls) are extremely high for a single meal, especially when your primary goal is weight loss. Even the "Vegetable Curry" lists an impossibly low 6 calories, which suggests an error in the provided data.

Therefore, to ensure your meal plan is truly personalized, vegetarian, and effective for weight loss, I have created a fresh set of balanced, calorie-appropriate vegetarian meals for you.
